# Coding principles never change
# Data structures are the unseen connections that organize and give meaning to dataw
#within your programs

## Interconnectedness
## Meaningful Organization
## Powerful python programmes


# Lists ---> the community gathering place --> []
## Ordered, changeable group of items(add,remove or reorder elements)

# Tuples ---> The unchanging promise --> ()
## Once created, they are fixed
## Ideal for storing data that should not be modified
## Use for: geographic Coordinates, RGB color values
## Are memory efficient , data consistency is paramount.

# Dictionaries ---> The village elders' wisdom
## Store information of key value pairs
## Lightning fast look ups
## For example: Phonebooks

# Sets ----> The circle of trusts
## Unique valued individuals, no duplicates are presents.
## Unique members -->unordered
## Membership tests
## Set operations ---> union,intersections,difference and symmetric difference

# Stacks & Queues
## Stacks and queues manage data flow in specific predictable ways
## Stacks(LIFO)--> Push or pop(remove) ; stack of plates
## Queues (FIFO) --> in lines

## Linked Lists & Trees

## Linked lists-> nodes are connected sequentially
## Binary tree -> hierarchical branching nodes
## Traversal methods -> search nodes systematically


# Wisdom in practice: Choosing the right structure

## Lists: for ordered collection of items that you frequently need to add, remove or modify
## think of flexible dynamic groupings i.e Shopping list(budget)

## Tuples: for fixed collection of related items where the data should never change,
## ideal for immutable records or coordinates

## Dictionaries: for rapid lookups based on unique keys. Perfect for mapping relationships
## or storing configuration

## Sets: when you need a collection of unique items, or for efficient membership
## testing and mathematical set operations.
